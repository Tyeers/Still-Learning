    <p>Lungmen</p><br>
    <p>Lungmen is an autonomous region of Yan, located between Kazdel and Ursus. A prosperous, advanced nomadi
        c city, Lungmen is governed by the Yan imperial family member Wei Yenwu.</p><br>
    <p>However, it acts as a "special economic zone" with greater autonomy such as a largely independent gover
        nment and economy, making it more progressive and open to foreign influences than Yan. Lungmen's econo
        mic prowess is shown by their currency, Lungmen dollar (LMD), which is used as Terra's global reserve 
        currency due to its stability.</p><br>
    <p>Lungmen's treatment towards the Infected is known to be harsh, though not to the same degree as the nei
        ghboring Ursus. The majority of the Infected Lungmenites were confined into slums where they live in l
        ower standards than the rest of the Lungmenites. That was before the invasion of the Reunion.</p><br>
    <p>Twenty years ago, in the year 1077, Lungmen suffered a devastating attack by the Ursus infiltrators led
         by the Duke of Kashchey as part of his wild imperialistic ambition. With all its security forces, Lun
         gmen was able to resist forceful annexation by the Ursus Empire.</p><br>
    <p>However, it came with the cost of the destruction of half of Lungmen and young Talulah was kidnapped by
         Kaschey during the crisis. Fearing that the city would be totally wiped out, Wei was forced to give u
         p Talulah in exchange for Kashchey's retreat.</p><br>
